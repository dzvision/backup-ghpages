A Much Profitable Xunlei Game Hall way out

Author： 暗香疏影  

According iResearch, as February 11, 2011, Xunlei has 291 million active users every month. Xunlei operates a powerful platform for digital media content, digital medial download and streaming base on cloud computing. Xunlei focus on the core software “Xunlei Downloader” and to diversify distribute software including multi-platform digital media content online steaming services since 2007; a piracy game distributer downloader transform to online gaming called Xunlei Game Hall; a phone helper with many great competitor for game download and storage transfer between PC and phone; a simple and easy “photoshop” kind of software and etc. The question is how do we make more profit then ever?  

First, the game distributed by local company has more way out on anti-piracy and powerful public relations which lead into a large sell in game industry. Since 2010 China has high-profile fight against piracy industry, many piracy industries including game and online media has closed and blocked. At the same time, a game developer and distributor called “Baiyou” have cooperated with many game developers. This company public relations did a great job on anti-piracy game, and successful distribute GUJIAN QITAN, XIANJIAN QIXIA ZHUAN 5(Legend of sword and Fairy 5) and Might & Magic Heroes 6. According various online media research, GUJIAN plus XIANJIAN sold 1.5 million, MMH6 launch just a week got 100 thousands units sold. We can see that China has a large potential market on game software.  

Second, the digital gaming software distribution has large number of potential spending power on the market. Steam earns five hundred million US dollars on first 2 Quarter of 2011. EA announces launch digital software distribution and called “Origin” with Battlefield 3. Origin has been installed by 3.9 million users as of September 2011. Steam has 40 million active accounts, and as of February 23th, 2012, there are 0.39% player using Simplified Chinese client which means there have at least 156 thousands active Chinese player from mainland.  

Third, the potential purchasing gaming software power is large because the subscription services have over 1.3 million subscribers for cloud-based service and video HD download as of February 2011. Xunlei must act quickly so it won’t lose to Tencent. We could learn from Steam developed by Valve Corporation. Xunlei Game could make a digital distribution, digital rights management, multiplayer, content delivery platform as Steam. We cooperate with larger software houses such as Ubi and EA and all other small independent developers worldwide. Since currency difference and spending power difference, we should have a lower cost than the original. Also we should localize the English gaming software into Chinese. We should restrict the area at the time he purchased based on IP address. We should count Hong Kong and Macau in the area to allow them to purchase game.  

Although the successful of subscribe membership and the successful of Baiyou has sold can’t be the reason develop a digital distribution software like Steam and Origin will gain and success. But what remains undoubted is that Steam has large Chinese player and we should make Xunlei game in to digital software distributor. This pilot scheme is a first mover in China, and since we are the vanguard, we will lead the digital distribution software in China, earn the most in digital distribution software market in China and even in Greater China Region.
