音乐盒的旋律走进了《i miss you》  
千千静听响起了那期待的意象

DayDream的曲目的确很好听  
那一首《Tears》让我迷醉  
  
  
我能感觉到你的拥抱  
和天使一样的微笑  
听到你的心跳  
每一分每一秒  

```
Here in the silence I wait
there's nothing else I can do 
it feels like my heart's gonna break
and all I can think of is you
and how my aching arms long to hold you 
and show you how much I care
but I'm counting the hours without you
and I don't know how much I can bear
because I miss you
more than words can say
and I need you here
in my life always
yeah I miss you
and I'll always be
waiting here for you
til you're back with me
you found a place in my heart
from the first moment I saw you
and you are my light in the dark
and I would do anything for you
cos you're everything I've ever wished for
the answer to all of my dreams
```
